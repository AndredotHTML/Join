                                obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be based
                                on
                                our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The respective legal
                                bases
                                on which a processing is based are explained in the following paragraphs of this Privacy
                                Policy.</p>
                            <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
                            <p>In the context of our business operations, we work with various external entities. In
                                some
                                cases, the transmission of personal data to these external entities is necessary. We
                                only
                                pass on personal data to external entities if this is necessary within the framework of
                                fulfilling a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transmission of data to
                                tax
                                authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in
                                transferring the data, or if another legal basis permits data transfer. In the case of
                                the
                                use of data processors, we only pass on our customers' personal data on the basis of a
                                valid
                                data processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a contract on joint
                                processing is
                                concluded.</p>
                            <h3>Revocation of Your Consent for Data Processing</h3>
                            <p>Many data processing processes are only possible with your explicit consent. You can
                                revoke
                                an already given consent at any time. The lawfulness of the data processing carried out
                                up
                                to the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

                                GDPR)</h3>
                            <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR,
                                YOU
                                HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR
                                SITUATION, TO
                                THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE
                                PROVISIONS. YOU CAN FIND THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH THE PROCESSING IS BASED IN
                                THIS
                                PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA
                                UNLESS
                                WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING PROTECTIVE REASONS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR
                                INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS NECESSARY FOR THE ASSERTION,

                            <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED IN ORDER TO CONDUCT DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE
                                RIGHT
                                AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR SUCH MARKETING
                                PURPOSES;
                                THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT
                                MARKETING. IF
                                YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEREAFTER NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING
                                PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
                            <h3>Right to File a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
                            <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to file a complaint
                                with
                                a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their usual residence,
                                their
                                place of work, or the place of the suspected infringement. This right to file a
                                complaint
                                exists without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
                            <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
                            <p>You have the right to receive data that we have processed automatically on the basis of
                                your
                                consent or for the fulfillment of a contract in a common, machine-readable format either
                                directly from us or, if you request it, to have it transmitted to a third party. Should
                                you
                                request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be
                                possible
                                insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>
                            <h3>Access, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
                            <p>You have the right, under the applicable legal provisions, at any time to obtain free of
                                charge information about your stored personal data, its origin, the recipients, and the
                                purpose of the data processing, and where applicable, the right to have this data
                                corrected
                                or deleted. You may contact us at any time for this or for further questions regarding
                                personal data.</p>
                            <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
                            <p>You have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
                                You
                                may contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restrict processing applies in
                                the
                                following cases:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time
                                    to
                                    verify this. During the verification period, you have the right to request the
                                    restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                                <li>If the processing of your personal data has been or is being carried out unlawfully,
                                    you
                                    can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                                <li>If we no longer require your personal data but you need it to exercise, defend, or
                                    assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing
                                    of
                                    your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                                <li>If you have objected under Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between
                                    your
                                    interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have
                                    the
                                    right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – apart from
                                their
                                storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or

                                of legal claims, or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person, or for

                                of a significant public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>

                                that results therefrom (name, inquiry) – will be stored and processed by us for the
                                purpose
                                of handling your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
                            <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, insofar as your

                                is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the execution of
                                pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate
                                interest in effectively processing the inquiries sent to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR)
                                or
                                on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if it has been requested; this consent can
